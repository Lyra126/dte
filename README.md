# CARE Demo Video
ARCC tackles a the need for support when it comes to mothers dealing with postpartum depression. It offers a simple daily check-in and mood tracker, providing valuable insights into their mental state. It also includes a journaling feature with randomized prompts to encourage mothers to express themselves. Additionally, we integrated deep breathing exercises and meditation to help mothers relax and manage stress. These features are linked to their profile. Lastly, we included a page for more tips on sleep, exercise, and other self-care practices to help mothers take some time for themselves.
